I currently use getpocket.com and I have saved several links and have been paying $4.99 per month to maintain premium subscription. I wanted to get off of pocket because it is not worth the price but I want my data, so I decided to try and export the data from pocket. The problem is, they export it as a raw html file with just the links. The thing I am missing from this export is the tags I created. The only way to view those is in the website, clicking on tags section and clicking on the tags to see which websites are part of that tag. I want to carry over this data into other services easily.

I am looking for someone who can create a very simple way for a user to login to their pocket account, and then scrape the websites saved and the tags that are associated so it can be exported into a service like airtable (CSV is fine).

Long term work available if you are able to get this job done. This includes building a replica of getpocket.com built off of an airtable base including a chrome extension and a simple mobile app that can have the same share with pocket type functionality. If you have experience building simple chrome extensions and extremely simple mobile app, please let me know.
